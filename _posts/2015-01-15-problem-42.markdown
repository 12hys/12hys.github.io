Solution to Problem 42. Written in Python.

Problem: The n<sup>th</sup> term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, `tn = n(n+1)/2`; so the first ten triangle numbers are:

`1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...`

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t<sub>10</sub>. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using [words.txt](https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p042_words.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?
