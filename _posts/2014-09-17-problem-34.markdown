Solution to Problem 34. Written in Python.

Problem: 145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/pypy

import math

answer = []
for n in range(3, 10000000):
    sum_of_factorials = sum(map(lambda x: math.factorial(int(x)), str(n)))
    if(sum_of_factorials == n):
        answer.append(sum_of_factorials)

print sum(answer)
```
