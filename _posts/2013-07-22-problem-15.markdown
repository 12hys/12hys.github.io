Solution to Problem 15. Solved using combinatorics.

Problem: Starting in the top left corner of a 2 x 2 grid, there are 6 routes (without backtracking) to the bottom right corner.

How many routes are there through a 20 x 20 grid?

The answer is the [binomial coefficient](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Binomial.html):
    C(40,20)
