Solution to Problem 37. Written in Python.

Problem: The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.


```python
#!/usr/local/bin/pypy

import euler_lib as lib

def trunked(number):
    trunked_left = [number]
    trunked_right = [number]

    left_digits = [int(x) for x in str(number)]
    right_digits = [int(x) for x in str(number)]

    length_digits = len(left_digits)

    for i in range(length_digits):
        left_digits.pop()
        right_digits.pop(0)

        if(len(left_digits) > 0):
            trunked_left.append(int(''.join([str(x) for x in left_digits])))

        if(len(right_digits) > 0):
            trunked_right.append(int(''.join([str(x) for x in right_digits])))

    return all(t in sieve for t in trunked_left) and all(t in sieve for t in trunked_right)

ctr = 0
number = 10
sieve = lib.eratosthenes_sieve(1000000)
answer = 0

while ctr != 11:
    if trunked(number):
        ctr += 1
        print "Found %s: %s" % (ctr, number)
        answer += number

    number += 1

print answer
```
