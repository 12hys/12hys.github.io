Solution to Problem 36. Written in Python.

Problem: The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001 (binary), is palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.

(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/pypy

import euler_lib as lib

answer = 0
for num in range(1000000):
    if lib.is_palindrome(num) and lib.is_palindrome(bin(num)[2:]):
        answer += num

print answer
```
