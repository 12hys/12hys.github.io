Solution to Problem 29. Written in Python.

Problem: Consider all integer combinations of ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 5:

2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32  
3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243  
4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024  
5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

    4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 100?

Update 9/22/2014: After learning that list comprehensions are much faster than traditional looping, I decided to reattempt this problem. Here is the runtime for each method on a Late 2013 MacBook Pro i7:

    method_one(): 0.614s
    method_two(): 0.025s


```python
#!/usr/local/bin/pypy

import cProfile

def method_one():
    numbers = range(2, 101)
    answer = []
    for aa in numbers:
        for bb in numbers:
            ans = pow(aa, bb)
            if(ans not in answer):
                answer.append(ans)

    print "Answer: %s" % (len(answer))

def method_two():
    numbers = range(2, 101)
    answer = len(list(set([pow(a, b) for a in numbers for b in numbers])))
    print "Answer: %s" % (answer)

cProfile.run('method_one()')
cProfile.run('method_two()')
```
