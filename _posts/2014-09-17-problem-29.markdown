Solution to Problem 29. Written in Python.

Problem: Consider all integer combinations of ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 5:

2<sup>2</sup>=4, 2<sup>3</sup>=8, 2<sup>4</sup>=16, 2<sup>5</sup>=32  
3<sup>2</sup>=9, 3<sup>3</sup>=27, 3<sup>4</sup>=81, 3<sup>5</sup>=243  
4<sup>2</sup>=16, 4<sup>3</sup>=64, 4<sup>4</sup>=256, 4<sup>5</sup>=1024  
5<sup>2</sup>=25, 5<sup>3</sup>=125, 5<sup>4</sup>=625, 5<sup>5</sup>=3125

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

    4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 100?

Update 9/22/2014: After learning that list comprehensions are much faster than traditional looping, I decided to reattempt this problem. Here is the runtime for each method on a Late 2013 MacBook Pro i7:

    method_one(): 0.614s
    method_two(): 0.025s
