Solution to Problem 28. Written in Python.

Problem: Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

    21 22 23 24 25
    20  7  8  9 10
    19  6  1  2 11
    18  5  4  3 12
    17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101. What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
