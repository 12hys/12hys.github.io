Solution to Problem 18 and 67. Written in Python.

Problem: By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)

```python
file = open('triangle-18.txt', 'r')
stringsOfNumbers = file.readlines()
listOfNumbers = []

for i in range(len(stringsOfNumbers)):
    stringsOfNumbers[i] = str(stringsOfNumbers[i]).rstrip('\n')
    '''
    split the strings using the space delim,
    convert to a tuple for conversion to int,
    and append to the main list of numbers
    '''
    listOfNumbers.append(tuple(str(stringsOfNumbers[i]).split(' ')))

listOfNumbers = [map(int, x) for x in listOfNumbers] #convert strings of numbers to int

sumOfTriangle = []
for currentRow in range(len(listOfNumbers)):
    if(currentRow==0):
        sumOfTriangle = listOfNumbers[currentRow]
    else:
        currentRowTemp = listOfNumbers[currentRow]
        for currentColumnIndex in range(len(currentRowTemp)):
            if(currentColumnIndex == 0): #first number in triangle
                currentRowTemp[currentColumnIndex] = sumOfTriangle[0] + currentRowTemp[currentColumnIndex]
            elif (currentColumnIndex == len(currentRowTemp)-1): #last number in the triangle
                currentRowTemp[currentColumnIndex] = sumOfTriangle[len(sumOfTriangle)-1] + currentRowTemp[currentColumnIndex]
            else: #everything in between
                value1 = currentRowTemp[currentColumnIndex] + sumOfTriangle[currentColumnIndex-1]
                value2 = currentRowTemp[currentColumnIndex] + sumOfTriangle[currentColumnIndex]
                if( value1 > value2 ):
                    currentRowTemp[currentColumnIndex] = value1
                else:
                    currentRowTemp[currentColumnIndex] = value2
        sumOfTriangle = currentRowTemp
print( 'Greatest sum of triangle:', max(sumOfTriangle) )
```
