Solution to Problem 21. Written in Python.

Problem: Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/pypy

import euler_lib as lib

amicable_numbers = []

for number in range(0, 10000):
    sum_of_divisor = sum(lib.get_divisors(number))
    
    if number != sum_of_divisor:
        if sum(lib.get_divisors(sum_of_divisor)) == number:
            amicable_numbers.append(number)
            amicable_numbers.append(sum_of_divisor)

print sum(lib.unique(amicable_numbers))
```
