Solution to Problem 52. Written in Python.

Problem: It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order.

Find the smallest positive integer, x, such that 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x, contain the same digits.

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/pypy

def same_digits(numbers):
    digits_list = [sorted([int(digit) for digit in str(number)]) for number in numbers]
    return all(cmp(x, digits_list[0]) == 0 for x in digits_list)

x = 2
while True:
    array = [x, 2*x, 3*x, 4*x, 5*x, 6*x]

    if same_digits(array):
        print x
        break

    x = x + 1
```
