Solution to Problem 19. Written in Python.

Problem: You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

* 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
* Thirty days has September, April, June and November. All the rest have thirty-one, Saving February alone, Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine. And on leap years, twenty-nine.
* A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/pypy

import calendar
from datetime import date

twentieth_century = range( 1901, 2001 )
months = range( 1, 13 )
sunday_count = 0

for year in twentieth_century:
    for month in months:
        if( date( year, month, 1 ).weekday() == 6 ):
            sunday_count += 1

print sunday_count
```
