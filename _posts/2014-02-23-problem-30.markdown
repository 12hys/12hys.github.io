Solution to Problem 30. Written in Python.

Problem: Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4  
8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4  
9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4  

As 1 = 1^4 is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/pypy

import euler_lib as lib

fifth_power = lambda x: x**5

answer = []
for i in range(2, (9**5)*6 + 1):
    sum_of_digits = sum(map(fifth_power, lib.get_digits(i)))

    if(i == sum_of_digits):
        answer.append(i)

print str(sum(answer))
```
