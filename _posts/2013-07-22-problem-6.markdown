Solution to Problem 6. Written in Python.

Problem: The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 12 + 22 + … + 102 = 385. The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + … + 10)2 = 552 = 3025. Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/pypy

x = range(1, 101)
sum_of_squares = 0

for ctr in x:
    sum_of_squares += pow(ctr, 2)

print str(pow(sum(x), 2) - sum_of_squares)
```
