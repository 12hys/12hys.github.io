Solution to Problem 5. Written in Python.

Problem: 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

```python
def loop(start):
    passAll = 0
    for ctr in range(1,21):
        if(start % ctr == 0):
            passAll += 1
        else:
            break
    if(passAll == 20):
        return True
    else:
        if(passAll > 15):
            print( str(start) + " passed the first " + str(passAll) + " numbers." )
        return False

while(loop(x) == False):
    x += 1
print( "Number: " + str(x) )
```
