Solution to Problem 179. Written in Python.

Problem: Find the number of integers 1 < n < 10^7, for which n and n + 1 have the same number of positive divisors. For example, 14 has the positive divisors 1, 2, 7, 14 while 15 has 1, 3, 5, 15.

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/pypy

import euler_lib as lib
from multiprocessing import Pool

p = Pool(8)
divisors = p.map(lib.get_divisor_count, range(2, 10**7))
p.close();

ctr = 0
for n in range(0, len(divisors) - 1):
    if divisors[n] == divisors[n+1]:
        ctr = ctr + 1

print ctr
```
