Solution to Problem 4. Written in Python.

Problem: A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

UPDATE: A much faster and shorter solution.

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/pypy

import euler_lib as lib

print max([i*j for i in range(100, 1000) for j in range(100, 1000) if lib.is_palindrome(i*j)])
```

Original Solution:

```python
def ispalindrome(x):
    palindrome = ''
    temp = x
    multiplier = 10
    for ctr in range(0,len(str(x))):
        lastDigit = temp%10
        temp = x/multiplier
        multiplier *= 10
        palindrome += str(lastDigit)
    if(palindrome == str(x)):
        return True
    else:
        return False

num1 = num2 = 999
product = 0
biggestPalindrome = 0
for ctr in range(num2,0,-1):
    for ctr2 in range(num1,0,-1):
        product = ctr * ctr2
        if(ispalindrome(product)):
            biggestPalindrome = max(product, biggestPalindrome)
print( str(biggestPalindrome) )
```
